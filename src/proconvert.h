// Conversion between ProPresenter's slide messages and what the rest of the app works
// with. Shared by the reader used for showing presentations and by the editor.
//
// Reading goes one way: a `Slide` message becomes a map (toSlideMap), which is all that
// QML ever sees of a slide. The map is flat and complete on purpose. Whatever has to be
// worked out is worked out here, once: which elements show (an element can be hidden,
// or shown only when another has text), and what text each shows (an element can show
// another's text in its own style). The views then only draw what they are given, and
// the output, the thumbnails and the editor cannot disagree about it.
//
// Writing goes the other way, and is never a whole slide: applyChanges() and writeText()
// alter fields of the message that was read, in place, and nothing else in it. That is
// the rule for every file this app writes: what it does not understand, it does not
// touch, so ProPresenter finds its own work as it left it.

bool readPresentation(const QString &path, rv::data::Presentation *presentation, QString *error);
// Writes one. Everything in the message, including fields this app does not know about,
// is written back as it was read. The file is replaced in one step, so a failure part
// way through leaves the original untouched. Returns an error message, empty on success.

// the file keeps beside it, which describe the start of the text, and the ranges that
// carry capitalisation and the families of fonts. Ranges of kinds this app does not

// A slide as the QML side consumes it: size, background, label, plain text, and a list
// of elements. Each element is a map of
//   id, name, x, y, width, height, rotation, opacity, locked, hidden
//   fillOn, fillKind ("color", "gradient", "media", "other" or "none"), fillColor, and
//     fillEnabled (on, and a plain colour, which is the kind that is drawn)
//   fillLinesOnly (the fill is only behind the lines of the text) and how: lineMaskStyle
//     (0 the box's width, 1 each line's, 2 the widest line's), lineMaskWidthOffset,
//     lineMaskHeightOffset, lineMaskHorizontalOffset, lineMaskVerticalOffset
//   fillShown (on, and of a kind that is drawn: a colour, a gradient, or a picture
//     that can be found), and for the other two kinds: fillGradientFrom,
//     fillGradientTo and fillGradientAngle (the first and last of its colours, and the
//     way it runs, in degrees anticlockwise from pointing right); fillMediaName,
//     fillMediaPath and fillMediaSource (the file, the last two empty if it cannot be
//     found or, the source, if it is a video, which is not drawn), fillMediaVideo and
//     fillMediaScale (0 to fit, 1 to fill, 2 stretched)
//   shape ("rectangle", "roundedRectangle", "ellipse", "arrow" or "other"), roundness
//     (of a rounded rectangle: its corners' radius as a part of its shorter side), and
//     outline (for anything but a rectangle: its points on the unit square, each
//     [x, y, in x, in y, out x, out y], the last four bending the outline on its way
//     into the point and out of it)
//   featherOn and featherRadius (its edges fading out, over that part of its shorter
//     side)
//   strokeOn, strokeColor, strokeWidth, and strokeEnabled (on, and wider than nothing)
//   shadow... and textShadow...: Enabled, Color (as drawn, opacity included), Angle,
//     Offset, Radius, and worked out from those OffsetX and OffsetY
//   words (the start of its own text, on one line: what an element with no name is
//     called in a list)
//   text (RichText, as authored), verticalAlignment, marginLeft/Top/Right/Bottom,
//   textScale (whether the text's size is changed to suit its box, as the file has it:
//     0 no, 1 the box's height suits the text instead, which is not done here, 2 made
//     smaller if it does not fit, 3 made larger if there is room, 4 either; see
//     StrokedText),
//     textTransform
//   linkKind ("none", "element", "timer", "slideText" or "other"): where the element's
//     text comes from, if it is not its own. For another element of the slide,
//     linkElementId, linkElementName and linkTransform. For a timer, linkTimerId and
//     linkTimerName (it is found by id, or failing that by name); linkTimerHours,
//     linkTimerMinutes, linkTimerSeconds and linkTimerHundredths (how each part of the
//     time is written, as Timers::Style), linkTimerHundredthsUnderMinute (the
//     hundredths only show in the last minute) and linkTimerPattern (text with
//     "${timer}" where the time goes). For the text of the slide that is live,
//     linkSlideNext (it is the one after it instead), linkSlideSource (which of its
//     text, as Show::Source), linkSlideName (the name of the elements whose text it
//     is, if it goes by name) and linkTransform. For anything else, which this app
//     does not show, linkLabel names it and linkPicture says whether it is a picture or
//     a colour that it puts in the element, in place of its fill, and not words
//   visibilityRules (bool), visibilityCriterion (0 all, 1 any, 2 none),
//     visibilityTimed (one of the conditions is about a timer, so whether the element
//     shows is not settled until it is drawn: see Slide.qml),
//     visibilityConditions: a list of { kind: "element", elementId, elementName, hasText }
//     and, for conditions on things this app does not track, { kind: "other", index,
//     label }
// and, worked out for the slide as it stands,
//   displayText (RichText: the text actually shown, after linking and transforming),
//   hasText, and visible (false if hidden or if its visibility rules say so).
// All geometry is in slide units.
//
// An element linked to a timer, or to the text of the slide that is live, shows
// something that is not in the slide at all, and that changes while the slide is on
// show. So its displayText only stands in for it (the timer at nothing, or no words,
// in the element's own style); what draws the element asks for the text as it is at
// the moment (SlideElement.qml). A stage layout is a slide made of text boxes like
// that. Another such thing, the clock say, is another linkKind handled in those same
// two places.
//
// An element linked to something this app does not show (linkKind "other") has no
// displayText at all. The text such an element has of its own is only a sample of the
// real thing ("1:23 PM" for the clock), which would pass for it if it were shown; the
// editor, where a sample is what is wanted, draws it from `text` (EditorCanvas.qml).
